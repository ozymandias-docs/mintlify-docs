description: "Overview of new and planned features for Continia Expense Management."
---

This article lists the features planned for release in the upcoming major release and those released as part of the most recent major release, including any features scheduled or released between these two major releases. Note that the delivery date can be any day within the specified month, and planned functionality may be postponed or not released at all (see Continia policy).

New major versions of all Continia solutions are released twice a year, on April 1 and October 1, in alignment with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central online release schedule. Whenever Microsoft releases a major version of Business Central online, Continia aims to release all online apps on the same day. On-premises versions are released within two weeks after each Business Central online release.

One to two weeks before each major release, a full preview version is released for the Business Central online sandbox environments.

## Application enhancements

The table below lists all features planned for general availability in the online version of Business Central, as well as their availability for public preview and early access. When a feature is available for public preview or early access, a green checkmark is displayed in the "Public preview" column, along with the month in which it was released.
