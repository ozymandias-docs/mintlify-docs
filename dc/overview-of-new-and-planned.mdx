      <li id="footnote-1">The release date for this feature is yet to be determined.</li>
      <li id="footnote-2">The release of this feature depends on the official release of OIOUBL 3.0, which the Danish Business Authority (Erhvervsstyrelsen) is currently working on.</li>
      <li id="footnote-3">As Continia has yet to see legal or business demands regarding the checking of signatures on incoming PDFs, this feature has been postponed to a later version of Document Capture.</li>
      <li id="footnote-4">The first part of this feature addressed most problems related to the user update. Therefore, there's no longer need to implement the second part of the optimization.</li>
      <li id="footnote-5">After looking into the possibilities, Continia has concluded that, for now, the use of artificial intelligence to determine account numbers wouldn't reduce processing time.</li>
      <li id="footnote-6">This feature was released in May 2025, in line with the requirements by the Australian and New Zealand governments.</li>
      <li id="footnote-7">This feature will be released either as part of a hotfix or of a service pack.</li>
      <li id="footnote-8">Due to changes in focus and legislation, Continia has decided to postpone the release of this feature.</li>
      <li id="footnote-9">This feature will be released as part of a service pack in November 2025.</li>
      <li id="footnote-10">Due to the official version of the KSeF API being available only at the end of September, this feature can't be released in October – but will be released with the next service pack.</li>
